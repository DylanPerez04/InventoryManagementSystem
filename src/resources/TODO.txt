* Implement read and write methods for InventoryItem to serialize and deserialize an
InventoryItem to and from a passed in File object (and record number)
* Add private field to InventoryItem to recognize which record number from the
Json array of InventoryItems has been read or has been written
* Add method to get the record number from InventoryItem
* Implement method in IMSSerializer to read_item and write_item (mimic SQL final project)
* Implement methods to manipulate and view items tracked by IMS

---- Dilemma 12/27/2024
i.      A decision must be made to either use reflection/read BeanPropertyDefinitions via Jackson or
create an enum object that contains all the fields of the InventoryItem object. This is necessary
for the purposes of displaying a field banner when printing out all the inventory items, in addition to
converting a string value into a recognizable field name of InventoryItem.
